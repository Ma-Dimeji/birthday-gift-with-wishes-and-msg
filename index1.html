        <h1>Dear Glory,</h1>
        <h2>
            Happy birthday to you!
            On your very special day today,
            I just want to show my appreciation
            for a friend and a sister so great.</h2>
        <h2>
            You’re the best kind of person to be
            around and you’re always there for
            me. </h2> 
        <h2>    
            I really am so grateful to have a
            friend like you.
            I count myself lucky to 
            Have found a buddy like you
            Because the truth is simply 
            That there are very few.</h2>
        <h2>
            I would even go as far as
            To say you’re one-of-a-kind
            A friend you should hold on to
            If you’re fortunate enough to find.</h2>
        <h2>
            I’m wishing the happiest birthday
            Possible to you today, best bud and sister.</h2>
        <h4>Your truly,</h4>
